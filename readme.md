# üñ±Ô∏è Custom Cursor DOM Practice Project

This is an interactive webpage built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**, designed as a creative front-end project to practice **DOM manipulation**, **mouse events**, and **visual effects** using modern web technologies.

## Project Purpose and Learning Goals

This project was created as part of my ongoing **MERN Stack learning journey** to build a strong foundation in **front-end interactivity** using the Document Object Model (DOM). The main objective was to implement a **custom cursor effect** that enhances user experience through smooth visual feedback.

### Through this project, I practiced:

- Using `mousemove` events in JavaScript to dynamically track and respond to user interactions.
- Manipulating DOM elements using `querySelector` and updating styles in real-time.
- Implementing **custom cursor design** using `border-radius`, `positioning`, and `mix-blend-mode`.
- Using **CSS transitions** to create smooth animations and fluid movement.
- Structuring responsive layouts with **Flexbox** to center and organize content.

This project serves as a **practical demonstration** of how JavaScript and CSS can work together to create **interactive, engaging web experiences** with minimal dependencies.
